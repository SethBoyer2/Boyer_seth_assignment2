## Description
In this assignment, I will be working with PEP8 Coding standards, declaring and assigning values to variables, and printing.

## Why are coding standards important?
I believe predefined standards in coding are most important when working within groups or sharing source code with others. This allows for all code to be reasonably understandable to newcomers to projects, and forces uniformity within groups as well. If everybody had their *own* unique standards that they stick to, projects would turn into very hard to understand messes chock full of formatting issues. Overall, coding standards allow for ethical work to be done in a way that makes sense for all parties involved.

## How does one employ ethical coding habits?
- Ensure that you only take in user information if they provide consent
- Be transparent with end users -- make sure they know exactly what your code does and why
- If you use somebody elses code or solution to a problem, always provide credit
- Provide proper documentation to go along with your code, including comments in the code itself
